# React_Chat_App
It's a full Realtime Chat Application. I used React on the front end, with NodeJS + Socket.io web socket library on the back end.

This app allows users to join a room and chat with individuals in that specific room. Current features in place include: join a room, send messages in that room, and send 
geolocation information. As users enter and leave the room, the room list updates and an admin message announces the change.
